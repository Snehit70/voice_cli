BASELINE TEST RESULTS - COMPLETED
================================================================================

Test 1: Hello, how are you today?
Expected: Hello, how are you today?
Result:   Hello. How are you today?
Groq:     Hello, how are you today?
Deepgram: Hello. How are you today?
Latency:  1.8s
Score:    [X]MINOR (period vs comma)

Test 2: My phone number is 555-123-4567.
Expected: My phone number is 555-123-4567.
Result:   My phone number is (555) 123-4567
Groq:     My phone number is 555-123-4567
Deepgram: My phone number is (555) 123-4567
Latency:  2.3s
Score:    [X]MINOR (added parentheses formatting)

Test 3: The API endpoint returns a JSON response.
Expected: The API endpoint returns a JSON response.
Result:   The API endpoint returns a JSON response.
Groq:     The API endpoint returns a JSON response.
Deepgram: The API endpoint returns a JSON response.
Latency:  2.2s
Score:    [X]EXACT ✅

Test 4: We're using Deepgram and Groq for transcription.
Expected: We're using Deepgram and Groq for transcription.
Result:   We are using Deepgram and Groq for transcription.
Groq:     We are using Deepgram and grok for transcription.
Deepgram: We are using Deepgram and grok for transcription
Latency:  2.0s
Score:    [X]MINOR (contraction expanded, merger fixed "Groq" capitalization)

Test 5: First, open the file; then, edit the configuration.
Expected: First, open the file; then, edit the configuration.
Result:   First, open the file, then edit the configuration.
Groq:     First open the file then edit the configuration
Deepgram: First, open the file, then edit edit the configuration.
Latency:  2.0s
Score:    [X]MINOR (semicolon→comma, merger fixed duplication)

Test 6: I'm testing the voice transcription system. The current implementation sends the entire audio file after I stop recording.
Expected: I'm testing the voice transcription system. The current implementation sends the entire audio file after I stop recording.
Result:   I am testing the voice transcription system. The current implementation sends the entire order file after I stop recording.
Groq:     I am testing the voice transcription system. The current implementation sends the entire order file after I stop recording.
Deepgram: I am testing the voice transcription system. The current implementation sends the entire audio file after I stop recording.
Latency:  2.2s
Score:    [X]MAJOR ❌ (Groq misheard "audio"→"order", merger chose wrong version)

Test 7: Their car is over there, and they're waiting.
Expected: Their car is over there, and they're waiting.
Result:   Their car is over there and they are waiting.
Groq:     Their car is over there and they are waiting.
Deepgram: Their car is over there and they are waiting.
Latency:  2.2s
Score:    [X]MINOR (missing comma, contraction expanded, homophones correct)

Test 8: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Expected: Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Result:   Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers.
Groq:     Peter Piper picked a peak of pickled peppers.
Deepgram: Peter piper picked a peak of pickled peppers.
Latency:  2.6s
Score:    [X]EXACT ✅ (Merger fixed "peak"→"peck" and capitalization!)

Test 9: Deploy the Docker container to Kubernetes using WebSocket streaming.
Expected: Deploy the Docker container to Kubernetes using WebSocket streaming.
Result:   Deploy the Docker container to Kubernetes using WebSocket streaming.
Groq:     Deploy the docker container to kubernetes using websocket streaming
Deepgram: Deploy the docker container to Kubernetes using WebSocket streaming.
Latency:  2.3s
Score:    [X]EXACT ✅ (Merger fixed all capitalization)

Test 10: Hmm, let me think about that for a moment.
Expected: Hmm, let me think about that for a moment.
Result:   Let me think about that for a moment.
Groq:     Let me think about that for a moment.

## BASELINE SUMMARY

Tested on: 2026-01-23
Total Tests: 10

EXACT:  3 / 10 (30%)
MINOR:  6 / 10 (60%)
MAJOR:  1 / 10 (10%)

Average Latency (after stop): 2.15 seconds

Key Findings:
- LLM merger is very effective at fixing errors (Test 4, 8, 9)
- One critical failure where merger chose wrong version (Test 6)
- Consistent 2-2.6s latency regardless of recording length
- Technical terms handled well
- Homophones correctly identified
- Filler words ("Hmm") dropped by both services
