# Project Architecture

`hyprvox` follows a feature-based directory structure to ensure high cohesion and low coupling between different parts of the system.

## Core Architecture

### 1. Daemon Lifecycle & Supervision
`hyprvox` operates as a persistent background daemon on Linux. It follows a multi-process architecture where a **Supervisor** ensures high availability of a **Worker** process.

- **Supervisor (`src/daemon/supervisor.ts`)**: The parent process that spawns and monitors the worker. It implements auto-restart logic with crash protection (max 3 crashes in 5 minutes).
- **Service (`src/daemon/service.ts`)**: The main "Event Loop" and orchestrator for the worker process. It maintains system state and coordinates between hardware (audio/keyboard) and remote APIs.
- **Systemd Integration**: The daemon can be managed as a systemd user service, which handles environment forwarding (`DISPLAY`, `WAYLAND_DISPLAY`) for clipboard and notification access.

### 2. State Machine
The daemon tracks its status via a formal state machine to ensure predictable behavior:
- `idle`: Waiting for hotkey trigger.
- `starting`: Initializing audio hardware.
- `recording`: Capturing audio from the microphone.
- `stopping`: Ending the recording session.
- `processing`: Sending data to transcription APIs and merging results.
- `error`: Recovering from a failure.

### 3. Global Hotkey Listener (`src/daemon/hotkey.ts`)
Uses `node-global-key-listener` to monitor keyboard events across the entire OS (Wayland/X11).
- **Toggle Mode**: First press triggers `start`, second press triggers `stop`.
- **Conflict Detection**: Verifies the hotkey isn't bound by other processes at startup.

### 4. Transcription Data Flow
The transcription cycle follows a strictly orchestrated path (see [STT Flow Details](STT_FLOW.md) for a deep dive):
1. **Trigger**: `HotkeyListener` emits a `trigger` event.
2. **Record**: `AudioRecorder` starts `arecord` via `node-record-lpcm16`. Audio chunks are streamed into a buffer.
3. **Conversion**: Audio is converted to optimal format (16kHz WAV Mono) for API consumption.
4. **Parallel Execution**: Audio is sent simultaneously to **Groq (Whisper V3)** and **Deepgram (Nova-3)**.
5. **LLM Merge**: If both APIs return results, an LLM (`src/transcribe/merger.ts`) merges them to combine Groq's technical accuracy with Deepgram's formatting. Model is configurable via `transcription.mergeModel`.
6. **Output**:
   - **Clipboard**: Final text is appended to the system clipboard (Wayland via `wl-copy`, X11 via `clipboardy`).
   - **History**: Transcription is logged to `~/.config/hyprvox/history.json`.
   - **Notification**: Desktop notification is sent via `notify-send`.

## Feature Modules

For details on using these modules programmatically, see the [Programmatic API Reference](API.md).

### 🎤 Audio Management (`src/audio/`)
- **`recorder.ts`**: Handles the `arecord` process lifecycle and provides a stream-based interface for recording.
- **`device-service.ts`**: Discovers and lists available ALSA input devices.
- **`converter.ts`**: Uses `ffmpeg` (or similar) to ensure audio format compatibility.

### 💻 CLI Interface (`src/cli/`)
- **`index.ts`**: The main entry point for CLI commands.
- **`status.ts`**: Provides real-time status by reading `daemon.state`.
- **`health.ts`**: Diagnostic tool to verify API keys and audio setup.

### ⚙️ Configuration Engine (`src/config/`)
- **`schema.ts`**: Zod-based validation schema for configuration.
- **`loader.ts`**: Handles reading from disk and merging with environment variables.
- **`service.ts`**: Singleton for config access with hot-reload support (SIGUSR2).
- **`writer.ts`**: Safely writes updates back to the configuration file with correct permissions (600).

### 📤 Output Systems (`src/output/`)
- **`clipboard.ts`**: Appends transcripts to the system clipboard with Wayland/X11 detection.
- **`notification.ts`**: Sends desktop notifications with support for different urgency levels.

### ☁️ Transcription Services (`src/transcribe/`)
- **`groq.ts`**: Integration with Groq Cloud SDK.
- **`deepgram.ts`**: Integration with Deepgram SDK.

### 🛠️ Utilities (`src/utils/`)
- **`logger.ts`**: Structured JSON logging with daily rotation.
- **`error-templates.ts`**: Standardized, user-friendly error messages.
- **`retry.ts`**: Generic retry logic with backoff and timeout handling.

## Error Handling & Resilience
- **API Fallback**: If one transcription service fails, the other is used automatically.
- **Fail Fast**: Prioritizes speed over exhaustive retries (max 2 attempts).
- **Audio Validation**: Automatically rejects recordings shorter than 0.6s and warns on silent audio.
- **Safety**: Never overwrites clipboard content; always appends to history.
- **Structured Error Responses**: All internal errors are mapped to user-friendly templates in `src/utils/error-templates.ts`.

## Contributor Guide

### Development Environment
- **Runtime**: [Bun](https://bun.sh) is the required runtime and package manager.
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode enabled).
- **Audio Logic**: Uses `node-record-lpcm16` which wraps `arecord`.
- **Keyboard Logic**: Uses `node-global-key-listener`.

### Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/snehit/hyprvox.git`
2. Install dependencies: `bun install`
3. Run in development mode: `bun run index.ts start`

### Testing
We use [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing.
- **Run all tests**: `bun test`
- **Run with coverage**: `bun test --coverage`
- **Unit tests**: Located in `tests/` directory, mirroring the `src/` structure.
- **Integration tests**: Located in `tests/integration/`.

### Code Style
- Follow the existing functional programming patterns where appropriate.
- Use `async/await` for all asynchronous operations.
- Ensure all new features are accompanied by tests.
- Add JSDoc comments for complex logic.

### Error Handling
- All new functions should have comprehensive error handling.
- Use `src/utils/error-templates.ts` for user-facing error messages.
- Log errors using the structured `logger` from `src/utils/logger.ts`.
