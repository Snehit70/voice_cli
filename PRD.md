# Voice CLI - Product Requirements Document

**Tagline:** "Speak, we will get it right"

## Overview

Voice CLI is a production-ready, system-wide speech-to-text daemon for Linux that runs in the background and transcribes voice to clipboard via a global hotkey. Built for developers and coders who need fast, accurate voice input for their workflows, agents, and tools.

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js >=20 (LTS)
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode, minimal `any` usage)
- **Package Manager**: Bun (primary), npm/npx compatible
- **Audio Capture**: TBD - research production-ready library for Linux
- **Global Hotkey**: `node-global-key-listener` (cross-platform, no root)
- **STT Engines**: Groq (Whisper Large V3) + Deepgram (Nova-3)
- **LLM**: Groq (Llama 3.3 70B) for transcript merging
- **Testing**: Vitest (80%+ coverage target)
- **Linting**: Biome (fast, all-in-one)
- **Logging**: Structured logging (for debugging user issues)

## Architecture

- **Pattern**: Feature-based structure (`/daemon`, `/audio`, `/transcribe`, `/output`, `/cli`, `/config`)
- **Code Style**: Mixed/pragmatic (use what fits best)
- **Configuration**: `~/.config/voice-cli/config.json` + environment variables
- **Daemon Management**: systemd service + built-in commands (start/stop/status/health)
- **Hotkey Behavior**: Toggle mode (press once to start, press again to stop)
- **Default Hotkey**: Right Control key

## Platform Support

- **Primary**: Linux with Wayland (Hyprland priority)
- **Secondary**: X11 support if possible
- **Distros**: All major Linux distributions (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.)
- **Future**: WSL support (v2.0)

## Data Models

### Transcription History (User-Facing)
```typescript
interface HistoryEntry {
  timestamp: Date;    // ISO 8601 format
  text: string;       // Final merged transcription
}
```

### Transcription Log (Debugging)
```typescript
interface TranscriptionLog {
  id: string;              // Unique ID (timestamp-based)
  timestamp: Date;         // When recorded
  text: string;            // Final merged text
  groqText?: string;       // Raw Groq result
  deepgramText?: string;   // Raw Deepgram result
  duration: number;        // Recording length (seconds)
  model: string;           // Models used (e.g., "groq+deepgram")
  boostWords?: string[];   // Custom vocabulary used
  processingTime: number;  // Time to process (ms)
  error?: string;          // Error message if failed
}
```

### Configuration Schema
```typescript
interface Config {
  apiKeys: {
    groq: string;
    deepgram: string;
  };
  hotkey: string;           // e.g., "RightControl", "F8"
  boostWords: string[];     // Max 450 words
  audioDevice?: string;     // Optional: specific mic device
  language: string;         // Default: "en" (English only for v1.0)
}
```

### Daemon State
```typescript
interface DaemonState {
  status: "idle" | "starting" | "recording" | "stopping" | "processing" | "error";
  pid: number;
  uptime: number;           // Seconds since start
  lastTranscription?: Date;
  errorCount: number;
  restartCount: number;
  health: {
    groqApi: boolean;
    deepgramApi: boolean;
    microphone: boolean;
    clipboard: boolean;
  };
}
```

- Passed to both Groq and Deepgram APIs
- Stored in config file

### 10. Desktop Notifications

## Validation Rules

### API Keys
- Groq API key: Must start with `gsk_` (format validation)
- Deepgram API key: Must be valid 40-character hex string (format validation)
- Both keys required before daemon can start

### Boost Words
- Maximum: 450 words (~500 tokens at 4 chars/token)
- Validation: Count words, reject if > 450
- Format: Array of strings in config file

### Audio Recording
- Minimum length: 0.6 seconds (reject shorter recordings)
- Maximum length: 5 minutes (auto-stop at 5:00)
- Warnings: Desktop notifications at 4:00 and 4:30
- Silent audio: Warn user if no audio detected

### Hotkey
- Must be a valid key combination
- Default: Right Control
- Validation: Check if key exists in `node-global-key-listener` key map
- Conflict detection: Warn if key already in use by system

### Configuration File
- Must be valid JSON
- Required fields: apiKeys.groq, apiKeys.deepgram
- Optional fields: hotkey, boostWords, audioDevice, language
- Corrupted file: Reset to defaults with user confirmation

## Error Handling Strategy

### Logging
- All errors logged to file (`~/.config/voice-cli/logs/error.log`)
- Structured format (JSON) for easy parsing
- Include timestamp, error type, stack trace, context

### User Notifications
- Critical errors: Desktop notification + log
- Non-critical errors: Log only
- User-friendly messages: Actionable, explain what went wrong and how to fix

### API Errors
- Groq timeout: Retry once, then fallback to Deepgram only
- Deepgram timeout: Retry once, then fallback to Groq only
- Both fail: Show error notification, log details, suggest checking API keys
- Invalid API key: Show setup instructions, link to API key pages

### Audio Errors
- No microphone: Show error notification, list troubleshooting steps
- Permission denied: Show error notification, explain how to grant permission
- Recording fails mid-recording: Abort, show error, suggest trying again

### System Errors
- Clipboard access denied: Fallback to file output (`~/.config/voice-cli/last-transcription.txt`)
- Daemon already running: Show error, suggest `voice-cli stop` first
- Config file corrupted: Offer to reset to defaults

### Retry Logic
- API calls: Max 2 attempts with short backoff (100ms, 200ms)
- Philosophy: Fail fast, let user retry manually
- No exponential backoff (prioritize speed over exhaustive retries)

## Security Considerations (v2.0)

For v1.0, security is deferred to v2.0:
- API keys stored in plain text in config file
- File permissions: chmod 600 for config file (basic protection)
- No encryption of sensitive data
- SSL certificate validation: Use library defaults

## Performance Considerations (v2.0)

For v1.0, performance optimization is deferred to v2.0:
- No specific latency targets
- No memory footprint limits
- Focus on functionality and correctness first
- Performance improvements in future versions

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Daemon starts on system boot via systemd
- [ ] Global hotkey (Right Control) triggers recording
- [ ] Audio recording works (0.6s min, 5min max with warnings)
- [ ] Dual STT transcription works (Groq + Deepgram in parallel)
- [ ] LLM merger produces high-quality transcriptions
- [x] Transcription copied to clipboard (APPEND mode, never overwrite)
- [ ] Desktop notifications work (recording start/stop, transcription ready, errors)
- [ ] CLI commands work (config, history, health, daemon start/stop/status)
- [ ] Error handling is robust (user-friendly messages, proper logging)
- [x] Tests pass with 80%+ coverage
- [ ] Documentation is complete (README, config reference, troubleshooting, architecture, API)
- [ ] Works on Hyprland (Wayland) - primary target
- [ ] Works on other Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch)
- [x] No clipboard overwrites (critical requirement verified)
- [ ] Daemon auto-restarts on crash (max 3 in 5 minutes)
- [ ] All validation rules enforced (API keys, boost words, audio, hotkey)

## Out of Scope (v2.0)

- WSL support (Windows hotkey forwarding)
- Performance optimization (latency, memory)
- Security hardening (encrypted API keys, secure storage)
- Multi-language support (English only for v1.0)
- Local STT fallback (whisper.cpp)
- Web UI (CLI/TUI only for v1.0)
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Windows)
- Plugin system (custom STT providers)

## Notes for Ralphy

- **Critical Requirement**: Clipboard APPEND mode (never overwrite) - test thoroughly
- **Wayland Priority**: Focus on Hyprland first, then other Wayland compositors
- **Error Messages**: Must be user-friendly and actionable
- **Code Quality**: TypeScript strict mode, minimal `any`, self-documenting code
- **Testing**: 80%+ coverage, focus on error handling and core logic
- **Documentation**: All 5 types required (README, config, troubleshooting, architecture, API)
- **Audio Library**: Research needed - choose production-ready library for Linux
- **Hotkey Library**: Use `node-global-key-listener` (confirmed)
- **Logging**: Structured format (JSON) for debugging user issues
- **Daemon**: systemd integration required for Linux
